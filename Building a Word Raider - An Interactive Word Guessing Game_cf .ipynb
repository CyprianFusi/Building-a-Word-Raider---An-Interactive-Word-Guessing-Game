    "* Prompt the player to guess a **n-letter word**\n",
    "* Provide some feedback as to whether the letters within their guess are in the word to guess\n",
    "* If the player guesses the **correct letter in the correct position**, that letter will be filled in on the console\n",
    "* If they guess a correct letter that belongs in the word, but it is **in the wrong position**, that letter will be added to a list of **misplaced letters, and an underscore will be shown in that position** on the console\n",
    "* If they guess a **letter that does not belong in the word**, that letter will be added to a **list of incorrect letters, and an underscore will be shown** in that position on the console. \n",
    "* The user will have a **maximum of 5 attempts** to guess the word.\n",
